    The Open<say-as interpret-as="characters">MC</say-as> data downloader offers
    a command line tool and a python <say-as interpret-as="characters">API</say-as>.

    <break time="0.2s"/>
    
    Both interfaces allow the downloading of preprocessed h5 cross section files.
    
    <break time="0.15s"/>
    
    There is a pie pie installer for the package and users can install the
    software with the command, pip install openmc data downloader.
    
    <break time="0.15s"/>
    
    Once installed the command line tool can be used.
    
    All the options can be found using the minus minus help argument.
    
    <break time="1.5s"/>
    
    A library or libraries are always needed and these should be provided in
    order of preference.
    
    <break time="0.15s"/>

    As you can see there are several options available including jeff 
    <say-as interpret-as="cardinal">3.2</say-as>, fendl 3.1d, tendl 2019,
    <say-as interpret-as="characters">WMP</say-as> and endf.

    <break time="0.15s"/>

    The downloader will try to find isotopes from the libraries provided.

    <break time="0.2s"/>
    
    If multiple libraries are provided then they will be searched
    preferentially in the input order.
    
    <break time="0.15s"/>
    
    Isotopes are downloaded and assigned filenames based on their library and
    isotope.
   
    <break time="0.15s"/>
    
    Additionally a cross sections <say-as interpret-as="characters">xml</say-as>
    file will also be made which allows use of the h5 files in
    Open<say-as interpret-as="characters">MC</say-as>
    
    <break time="0.15s"/>
    
    This allows users easily to create a fully reproducible nuclear data environment.
    
    <break time="0.15s"/>
    
    You can download specific isotopes from specific libraries using minus l for
    library and minus i for isotope.

    <break time="1.5s"/>

    Running the same command again will detect that the cross sections have
    been downloaded and skip the downloading.

    <break time="1.5s"/>

    Elements can also be requested using the minus e for elements argument, and
    will automatically be expanded to their natural abundances.

    <break time="1.5s"/>

    Elements and isotopes can both be specified by combining minus e and minus
    i arguments.

    <break time="1.5s"/>

    The h5 files can be sent to a specific directory using the minus d argument.

    <break time="1.5s"/>
    
    By default the h5 files for neutrons are downloaded, but different
    particles, or a combination of particles can be specified using the minus p
    for particles argument.
    
    <break time="0.15s"/>

    Acceptable options are photon and neutron.

    <break time="1.5s"/>

    The package can also be imported into a python script and used in
    conjunction with Open<say-as interpret-as="characters">MC</say-as> to
    download the nuclear data required for the simulation.

    <break time="0.15s"/>
    
    In this example we see that Open<say-as interpret-as="characters">MC</say-as>
    data download has been imported as <say-as interpret-as="characters">odd</say-as>.
    
    <break time="0.15s"/>

    An Open<say-as interpret-as="characters">MC</say-as> material has been made and
    that material has been passed to the just in time library generator with a
    preference for the fendl nuclear data library.

    <break time="0.15s"/>
    
    Once run, this python script will now download the nuclear data required
    for simulating with this material.
    
    <break time="0.15s"/>
    
    The just in time download can also be called with a list of material objects.
    
    <break time="1.5s"/>
    
    Also an Open<say-as interpret-as="characters">MC</say-as> materials object
    can be used.
    
    <break time="1.5s"/>
    
    Additionally Material objects and Multi Material objects from the
    neutronics material maker can also be used.
    
    <break time="1.5s"/>
    
    The Open<say-as interpret-as="characters">MC</say-as> cross section
    enviromental varible is automatically set to the path of the new cross
    section.xml that has been generated on the fly.
    
    <break time="0.15s"/>
    
    This means that launching a simulation from the same python script tells
    Open<say-as interpret-as="characters">MC</say-as> to make use of the 
    recently downloaded cross sections.
    
    <break time="0.15s"/>

    I hope you like the python package and it helps with your 
    Open<say-as interpret-as="characters">MC</say-as> nuclear data needs
    , if you have any feed back then feel free to raise issues on the github
    repository page. Thanks for listening, the link for the repository is in
    the description.
